# bun + elysia + vike

This is a minimal example of using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) with [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) and [Vike](https://vike.dev/). For instant results, the `vike-react` extension is used to provide some basic components.

Cool thing; we could easily swap out Elysia for another server framework like Fastify, Express, Koa, etc. See the `server.ts` file in root.

install deps
```shell
bun install
```

run dev
```shell

```

run prod like
```shell
bun run prod
```

run build only
```shell

```

start prod server only
```shell

```
